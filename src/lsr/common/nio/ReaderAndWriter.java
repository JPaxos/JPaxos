/**
 * This class provides default implementation of <code>ReadWriteHandler</code>
 * using java channels. It provides method used to send byte array, which will
 * be send as soon as there will be space in system send buffer. Reading data is
 * done using <code>PacketHandler</code>. After setting new
 * <code>PacketHandler</code> to this object, reading mode is enabled, and reads
 * data to fill entire byte buffer(provided by <code>PacketHandler</code>). If
 * no space remains available in read buffer, <code>PacketHandler</code> is
 * notified by calling <code>finish</code> method on it. The handler is removed
 * after reading whole packet, so it has to be set again.
