/**
 * This interface represents state machine with possibility to save current
 * state (snapshot). It is used by implementations of a replica to execute
 * commands from clients, for making snapshots, and also to update the state
 * from other snapshot (received from other replica).
 * <p>
 * All methods are called from the same thread, so it is not necessary to
 * synchronize them.
 * <p>
 * After creating new snapshot by this <code>Service</code>, all
 * <code>SnapshotListener</code> should be called. They shouldn't be called
 * after updating state machine from snapshot (see <code>updateToSnapshot</code>
 * for more details).
 * <p>
 * This interface provides two methods used for notifying that the snapshot
 * should be made. First is only asking for snapshot, which can be ignored if
 * for service it is bad moment for creating snapshot. Second methods is called
 * when logs are much bigger than estimated size of next snapshot.
 * <p>
 * For some methods, also instance number is provided. It is used to determine
 * when the snapshot by <code>Service</code> was made. The number of created
 * snapshot is first <b>not</b> executed instance. If last executed instance
 * before snapshot was <code>x</code> then snapshot number is <code>x+1</code>.
