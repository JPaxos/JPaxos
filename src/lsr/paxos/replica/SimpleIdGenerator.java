 * <p>
 * A client id generator that starts by generating small numbers. Having small
 * client ids can be convenient for debugging and for some specific situations.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If used correctly, this generator will ensure unique ids. If replicas are not
 * allowed to recover, then it is enough to initialize the generator to:
 * 
 * <code>new SimpleIdGenerator(replicaID, nReplicas)</code>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The generated ids will be of the form <code>replicaID + k*nReplicas</code>,
 * which ensures that each replica generates its own unique stream of ids.
 * 
 * <p>
 * If replicas are allowed to recover, then ids are not guaranteed to be unique
 * after recovery. To prevent this, the replica should keep on stable storage
 * the last id that it generated and when recovering initialize this class to
 * start from this id. This is not implemented.
