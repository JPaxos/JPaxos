JPaxos /master/
===============

Description
-----------

JPaxos is a Java library and runtime system for efficient state machine
replication. With JPaxos it is very easy to make a user-provided service
tolerant to machine crashes. Our system supports the crash-recovery model of
failure and tolerates message loss and communication delays.

You are free to use JPaxos as an experimental platform for research into
software-based replication, or as a library for your commercial products,
provided that the LGPL3.0 licence is respected (see the LICENCE file).

Our system implementation is based on solid theoretical foundations, following
the state-of-the-art in group communication research. We intend to publish some
of the scientific results of the JPaxos project in the future.
